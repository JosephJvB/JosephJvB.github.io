<!-- I was supposed to be a lawyer. But I have found things I really enjoy about this job -->
<!--
  I love node: I love scripting, http requests and express web servers. I love vscode: I love themes, shortcuts and especially the visual git diff. I love using a unix terminal with z-shell. My .zshrc is nice and messy with custom and poached aliases from other's dotfiles. Did you know 'rc' in config files stands for 'run commands'. I have just googled that a minute ago.
-->
<!--
  I have been learning some basic C# scripting to create Azure Serverless functions. Strongly typed languages are quite nice actually. Learning Azure has been fun for me also, hosting is its own learning which I have only done a little of so far.
-->
<!--
  I love my family. My Dad is recovering from major surgery. He had a diagnosis that his skin cancer had spread. He'll be starting radiotherapy soon, then chemo after that. I love that I live in the same city as him and my mum so I can visit them often. My brother is in Sydney doing a PHD and I can tell that's hard for him. He came over for the week of Dad's surgery which was awesome.

  I miss skateboarding, I miss mountain-biking. When I lived in Wellington, NZ I would do those things often. Now that an adult in Auckland, there are no close bike-tracks, my bike got stolen and I dont like the skatepark. Now I visit my parents, play videogames and write code in my free time. I am going on a ski-trip with friends in August, that will be good. My friends aren't from the tech / dev world, they are close mates from High School days and I love them a lot.

      <h2>Personal Profile</h2>

      <p class="job-title">Junior full stack web developer</p>
      <p>I worked as part of a team of 3 developers to turn a paper-based, self-discovery assessment into a progressive web app to be used by schools all around New Zealand. I participated in sprint-planning, presentation and feedback sessions with business.</p>
      <p>The small size of the team meant I was able to participate in all elements of the app build, front-end, back-end and cloud hosting. I worked closely with more experienced developers in a mentor/mentee relationship.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Front-end: React.js (w/ Redux-Thunk, Recompose and Reselect), CSS (/w Fela.js)</li>
        <li>Back-end: Node.js (w/ Express, Knex and Feathers)</li>
        <li>Hosting: Heroku (w/ Postgresql, Coralogix app-logging, Cronjobs), Netlify, Mailchimp (w/ Mandrill) </li>
        <li>Testing: Codecept (automated user acceptance testing) and Load Impact (load testing)</li>
